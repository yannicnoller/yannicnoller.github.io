This poses significant challenges to computing education, particularly the teaching of introductory programming and advanced software engineering (SE) courses. First-year programming courses often face overwhelming enrollments, including interdisciplinary students who are not CS majors. The high teacher-to-student ratio makes it challenging to provide timely and high-quality feedback. Meanwhile, software engineering education comes with inherent difficulties like acquiring industry partners and the dilemma that such software projects are often under or over-specified and one-time efforts within one team or one course. To address these challenges, we designed a novel foundational SE course. This SE course envisions building a full-fledged Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) of Programming Assignments to provide automated, real-time feedback for novice students in programming courses over multiple years. Each year, SE students contribute to specific short-running SE projects that improve the existing ITS implementation, while at the same time, we can deploy the ITS for usage by students for learning programming. This project setup builds awareness among SE students about their contribution to a “to–be–deployed" software project. In this multi-year teaching effort, we have incrementally built an ITS that is now deployed in various programming courses. This paper discusses the Intelligent Tutoring System architecture, our teaching concept in the SE course, our experience with the built ITS, and our view of future computing education.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">TOSEM’25</abbr> </div> <div id="tosem25_crashrepair" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Vulnerability Repair via Concolic Execution and Code Mutations</div> <div class="author"> Ridwan Shariffdeen, Christopher Timperley, <em>Yannic Noller</em>, Claire Le Goues, and Abhik Roychoudhury </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a class="bibtex btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Bib</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/tosem2025_crashrepair.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Security vulnerabilities detected via techniques like greybox fuzzing are often fixed with a significant time lag. This increases the exposure of the software to vulnerabilities. Automated fixing of vulnerabilities where a tool can generate fix suggestions is thus of value. In this work, we present such a tool, called CrashRepair, to automatically generate fix suggestions using concolic execution, specification inference, and search techniques. Our approach avoids generating fix suggestions merely at the crash location because such fixes often disable the manifestation of the error instead of fixing the error. Instead, based on sanitizer-guided concolic execution, we infer desired constraints at specific program locations and then opportunistically search for code mutations that help respect those constraints. Our technique only requires a single detected vulnerability or exploit as input; it does not require any user-provided properties. Evaluation results on a wide variety of CVEs in the VulnLoc benchmark, show CrashRepair achieves greater efficacy than state-of-the-art vulnerability repair tools like Senx. The repairs suggested come in the form of a ranked set of patches at different locations, and we show that on most occasions, the desired fix is among the top-3 fixes reported by CrashRepair.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">tosem25_crashrepair</span><span class="p">,</span>

Many proposed repair techniques rely on available test suites, since tests are available in real-world settings. Tests are incomplete specifications, however. As a result, repairs generated based on tests may suffer from the test overfitting problem. The patches produced by APR techniques may pass the given tests and thus be plausible, and yet be an incorrect patch. This hints towards more extensive test suites to guide program repair. Generating additional tests to improve the test suite quality is generally difficult because the oracle or expected observable behavior of the generated tests is unknown. In our work, we first construct additional oracles by instrumenting buggy programs from the Defects4J benchmark with the knowledge obtained from the available bug reports. Then, we formulate a coevolution approach that generates tests and repairs in a unified workflow. The complete workflow is implemented as an extension of the well-known Java testing framework EvoSuite. This includes re-purposing the search in EvoSuite to search for repairs (instead of searching for tests) and enables an easy adoption for developers who are already familiar with EvoSuite for test suite generation. The evaluation of our tool EvoRepair shows that coevolution has a positive impact on the quality of patches and tests. In future, we hope that coevolution of patches and tests can inspire new repair tools and techniques.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">evorepair</span><span class="p">,</span>

Trust in automatically generated patches is necessary for achieving greater adoption of program repair. Towards this goal, we survey more than 100 software practitioners to understand the artifacts and setups needed to enhance trust in automatically generated patches. Based on the feedback from the survey on developer preferences, we quantitatively evaluate existing test-suite based program repair tools. We find that they cannot produce high-quality patches within a top-10 ranking and an acceptable time period of 1 hour. The developer feedback from our qualitative study and the observations from our quantitative examination of existing repair tools point to actionable insights to drive program repair research. Specifically, we note that producing repairs within an acceptable time-bound is very much dependent on leveraging an abstract search space representation of a rich enough search space. Moreover, while additional developer inputs are valuable for generating or ranking patches, developers do not seem to be interested in a significant human-in-the-loop interaction.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">trustapr_icse2022</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, existing repair techniques modify a buggy program such that it passes given tests. Such repair techniques do not discriminate between correct patches and patches that overfit the available tests (breaking untested but desired functionality). We propose an integrated approach for detecting and discarding overfitting patches via systematic co-exploration of the patch space and input space. We leverage concolic path exploration to systematically traverse the input space (and generate inputs), while ruling out significant parts of the patch space. Given a long enough time budget, this approach allows a significant reduction in the pool of patch candidates, as shown by our experiments. We implemented our technique in the form of a tool called ’CPR’ and evaluated its efficacy in reducing the patch space by discarding overfitting patches from a pool of plausible patches. We evaluated our approach for fixing real-world software vulnerabilities and defects, for fixing functionality errors in programs drawn from SV-COMP benchmarks used in software verification, as well as for test-suite guided repair. In our experiments, we observed a patch space reduction due to our concolic exploration of up to 74% for fixing software vulnerabilities and up to 63% for SV-COMP programs. Our technique presents the viewpoint of gradual correctness - repair run over longer time leads to less overfitting fixes.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">cpr</span><span class="p">,</span>

Two executions are said to be diverging if the observable program behavior differs, e.g., in terms of program output, execution time, or (DNN) classification. The key challenge of differential software analysis is to simultaneously reason about multiple program paths, often across program variants.This paper presents HyDiff, the first hybrid approach for differential software analysis. HyDiff integrates and extends two very successful testing techniques: Feedback-directed greybox fuzzing for efficient program testing and shadow symbolic execution for systematic program exploration. HyDiff extends greybox fuzzing with divergence-driven feedback based on novel cost metrics that also take into account the control flow graph of the program. Furthermore HyDiff extends shadow symbolic execution by applying four-way forking in a systematic exploration and still having the ability to incorporate concrete inputs in the analysis. HyDiff applies divergence revealing heuristics based on resource consumption and control-flow information to efficiently guide the symbolic exploration, which allows its efficient usage beyond regression testing applications. We introduce differential metrics such as output, decision and cost difference, as well as patch distance, to assist the fuzzing and symbolic execution components in maximizing the execution divergence.We implemented our approach on top of the fuzzer AFL and the symbolic execution framework Symbolic PathFinder. Weillustrate HyDiff on regression and side-channel analysis for Java bytecode programs, and further show how to use HyDiff for robustness analysis of neural networks.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">hydiff</span><span class="p">,</span>

Side-channel vulnerabilities are difficult to reason about as they involve analyzing the correlations between resource usage over multiple program paths. We present DifFuzz, a fuzzing-based approach for detecting side-channel vulnerabilities related to time and space. DifFuzz automatically detects these vulnerabilities by analyzing two versions of the program and using resource-guided heuristics to find inputs that maximize the difference in resource consumption between secret-dependent paths. The methodology of DifFuzz is general and can be applied to programs written in any language. For this paper, we present an implementation that targets analysis of Java programs, and uses and extends the Kelinci and AFL fuzzers. We evaluate DifFuzz on a large number of Java programs and demonstrate that it can reveal unknown side-channel vulnerabilities in popular applications. We also show that DifFuzz compares favorably against Blazer and Themis, two state-of-the-art analysis tools for finding side-channels in Java programs.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">diffuz</span><span class="p">,</span>
