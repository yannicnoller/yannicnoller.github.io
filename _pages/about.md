<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

<!-- Yannic Noller is an Assistant Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where he leads the Software Engineering research group. His current research focuses on software testing, automated program repair, machine learning analysis, intelligent tutoring systems, and human factors in SE. Before joining SUTD in 2023, Yannic was a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and served as the Assistant Director of the Ministry of Education (MoE) Tier 3 program on Automated Program Repair. He pursued his Ph.D. in Computer Science in the Software Engineering group (Prof. Lars Grunske) at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany. -->

<!-- > UPDATES:<br> I recently joined the [Ruhr-University Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/en/)! I will [hire PhD students](./positions) for my new group, let me know if you want to work with me! -->

Yannic ([CV](./cv)) is a professor at the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://informatik.rub.de/en/) at the [Ruhr University Bochum (RUB)](https://informatik.rub.de/en/) and leads the [Software Quality](https://informatik.rub.de/en/research/chairs/sq/) group. His research focuses on how software quality can be maintained and improved with automated testing and repair technologies. His general research goal is to shape the future of software development by contributing to the domain of automated software engineering and providing the means to develop reliable, trustworthy, and secure software systems. 
In particular, he works in the following areas:

<!-- <img title="Research Topics" alt="Research Topics" src="/assets/img/ResearchIntro_Yannic.jpg" width="350px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;"/> -->

1. **Automated Program Repair**: developing novel repair techniques to aid developers in fixing program bugs
2. **Machine Learning Analysis**: automated analysis, testing, and repairing of machine learning models
3. **Software Testing**: exploring and designing (hybrid) testing techniques to systematically generate test inputs that expose incorrect program behavior
4. **Intelligent Tutoring Systems**: how to help CS students learn programming by applying concepts from automated testing and repair to guide the students toward the right solution
5. **Human Factors in SE**: studying developer needs and requirements for successful deployment of testing and repair techniques in development practice


Before joining RUB in July 2024, Yannic was an *Assistant Professor* at [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://sutd.edu.sg/) and a *Research Assistant Professor* in the Department of Computer Science at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg/). He pursued his Ph.D. in Computer Science in the Software Engineering group (advised by [Prof. Lars Grunske](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/Members/lars-grunske)) at the [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en), Germany. His Ph.D. research focused on differential software testing, in particular, by combining fuzzing and symbolic execution in the context of regression analysis, algorithmic complexity analysis, side-channel analysis, and robustness analysis of neural networks.
