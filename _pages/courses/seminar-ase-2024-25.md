### Content
---
This seminar explores the latest advancements in automated software engineering (ASE) and methods to improve software quality, with focus on

* software testing (regression testing, fuzzing, symbolic execution, etc.),
* program repair (search-based, semantic-based, template-based, ML-based, etc.),
* program analysis (static/dynamic program analysis),
* automated software engineering agents/bots,
* software engineering education (e.g., intelligent tutoring), and
* human factors in software engineering.

Each student picks a research topic from a provided list, writes a corresponding seminar paper which elaborates the chosen topic, presents the results in the seminar followed by discussion of the topic with all students, and evaluates papers by the other students. To support this process, the principles of scientific work are discussed as part of the seminar.

<br>
### Recommended Prior Knowledge
---
212000 - Software Engineering


<br>
### Learning Outcomes
---
* learn principles of scientific and academic working (research, evaluation, presentation, and writing)
* gain insights into the discussed research topics in automated software engineering


<br>
### Learning Methods
---
Research seminar, i.e., we meet weekly in small group of students and the instructor, focusing each time on some particular topic, in which everyone present is requested to participate. The seminar style simulates a scientific conference, where papers are evaluated, presented, and discussed.


<br>
### Requirements for the awarding of the credit points
---
* Active participation in all presence events
* 60-seconds-talk incl. feedback
* Submission of the talk outline and the table of contents for the paper
* Submission of the paper for peer-review
* Review for at least two other student papers 
* Final presentation
* Final paper submission (10+2 pages, two columns, template provided)
