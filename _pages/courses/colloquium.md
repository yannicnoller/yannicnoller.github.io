This research colloquium features presentations and discussions by and with group members and guests of the chairs of [Software Engineering](https://se.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/research-colloquium/) (Prof. Dr. Thorsten Berger) and [Software Quality](https://informatik.rub.de/en/sq/) (Prof. Dr. Yannic Noller). The weekly colloquium focuses on the current research in software engineering and related areas. Also, it includes kick-off talks and final presentations of Bachelor’s/Master’s thesis, as well as presentations on ongoing research topics. Attendance is mandatory for all Bachelor’s and Master’s thesis writers. The colloquium is also intended for those interested in a Bachelor’s/Master’s thesis topic to drop by and discuss possible topics with us.
