This week I attended the [Shonan Meeting 217](https://shonan.nii.ac.jp/seminars/217/) on Trusted Automatic Programming! It was a great place to be and meet [colleagues and friends](https://bsky.app/profile/yannicnoller.bsky.social/post/3lgdpxzvsn22b)! I presented our ongoing work on developing AI-based assistance in debugging education. Check my [slides](/assets/pdf/2025_01_Simulated-Interactive-Debugging.pdf)!
