Enjoyed the [FUZZING'25 workshop](https://fuzzingworkshop.github.io/editions/2025/index.html) with great participants and keynote speakers! Miryung Kim (UCLA and Amazon Web Services) talked about here research on constraining fuzzing and Will Wilson (Antithesis) provided interesting insights into career paths in fuzzing outside academia. Check our [program](https://fuzzingworkshop.github.io/editions/2025/program.html) and watch the keynote recordings!
