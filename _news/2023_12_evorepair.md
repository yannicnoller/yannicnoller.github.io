Our work on "Evolutionary Testing for Program Repair" has been accepted for [ICST 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icst-2024)! With EvoRepair, we explore a coevolution approach that generates tests and repairs in a unified workflow using EvoSuite. Check our [preprint](/assets/pdf/icst2024_ruan_evorepair.pdf)!
