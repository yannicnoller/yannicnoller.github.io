Had a great time at the [Summer School on Security Testing and Verification 2025](https://cybersecurity-research.be/summer-school-on-security-testing-and-verification-2025) organized by the KU Leuven and VUB! It was great to engage with the participants and present our research in fuzzing :) For more info, check the website or this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cybersecurity-vlaanderen_cybersecurity-securitytesting-sast-activity-7350472649543745537-G9Sl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABCQ0kwBg8QbNa9Qqw18ym9_X9raCQK7ctY)!
